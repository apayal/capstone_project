This is my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science certificate program titled, â€œPredicting Credit card defaults using ML."

In this project, I use Machine Learning techniques to create a model that will predict who might default on their payments.
I perform various methods of data visualization and communication to convey findings and actionable insights.

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

The notebooks in order are as follows: all .ipynb files

Loading and Cleaning
EDA
Modeling

The data in this file are required:


taiwan_data.csv
credit_df_dataset_cleaned.csv

2 csv's are created in the modeling notebook:

model_scores_best_parms
model_scores_pca
